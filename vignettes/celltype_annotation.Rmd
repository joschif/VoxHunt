This vignette will show you how to use VoxHunt to annotate brain organoid cells by mapping them to spatial locations in the developing mouse brain. VoxHunt takes single-cell gene expression data as an input and can handle two general formats:

* A cells x genes matrix with normalized data
* A Seurat object

If you input a Seurat object that has been clustered, VoxHunt wil recognize it and perform the analysis on each cluster separately.
